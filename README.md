# FBForms - A simple and elegant GUI library for Windows, based on win api.

FBForms is a wip project, I will add more features when I get spare time.
FBForms is created with performance in mind. So I tried to avoid memory allocations as much as possible. This is possible with using existing buffers. By re-using existing buffers, we can reduce memory allocations to an extent.

## Features Completed
- PtrList - A dynamic list type which can hold any ptrs.
- Form 
- Button - Has 3 styles, normal, flat color, gradient
- Calendar
- CheckBox
- ComboBox
- DateTimePicker
- GroupBox - Has 3 styles, system, classic, overriden
- Label
- ListBox
- ListView - Beutyfied headers.
  
## Work In Progress
- Menu & Context Menu
